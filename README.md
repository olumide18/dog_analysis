# dog_analysis

**Objective:**
The objective of this project was to clean and preprocess a dataset containing dog-related information to ensure its quality and usability for further analysis. By leveraging Python programming, the goal was to address issues such as missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies, and outliers, thereby enhancing the reliability of the data for subsequent analysis tasks.

**Methodology:**
The methodology involved a systematic approach to data cleaning using Python libraries and techniques. Firstly, I conducted an initial assessment of the dataset to identify common data quality issues. Next, I implemented data cleaning procedures such as handling missing values through imputation or deletion, identifying and removing duplicate entries, standardizing formats to ensure consistency, and detecting and addressing outliers. Additionally, I performed data validation to verify the integrity of the cleaned dataset and ensure its suitability for analysis.

**Result:**
Through the application of Python-based data cleaning techniques, the dataset was successfully processed to mitigate various data quality issues. Missing values were handled appropriately, duplicates were removed, inconsistent data formats were standardized, and outliers were addressed. As a result, the cleaned dataset was deemed reliable and ready for further analysis, facilitating meaningful insights into dog-related information.
